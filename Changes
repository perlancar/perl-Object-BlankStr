Revision history for Object-BlankStr

0.05     2013-09-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes. Rebuild with MakeMaker instead of
           Module::Build because the latter is deprecated from core in 5.19.


0.04    2011-08-03 (SHARYANTO)

        [FIXES]

        - Avoid error "Modification of a read-only value attempted" in Perl
          5.12.4+ (thanks Randy Stauner).


0.03    2011-07-28 (SHARYANTO)

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - No longer stringifies to " \b" but to "". No longer has true value *in
          all cases* (e.g. print 1 if $obj won't print 1), but die $obj still
          works as advertised.


0.02    2011-07-26 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Fix synopsis.


0.01    2011-07-26 (SHARYANTO)
